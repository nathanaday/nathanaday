Hi, I'm @nathanaday

I have been developing software for automation, vision, and IoT for the past 4 years. I believe data visualization is just as important as data handling, and thankfully I do both.

My mains:
- 🐍 Python - I've made more enterprise level components in Python than anything else. I am a fan of OpenCV and FastAPI.
- 🌐 Vue.js - While I spend a lot of time in the back end, people I work with know me for my nice UI's and thoughtful UX. I build with Vue.js and Vite.
- 🔧 C++ - Anything from low-level device drivers and sensor layers to making high-powered GUI's with the wonderful Qt framework.

Newer:
- 🐹 Go - Rewritting a lot of my python components in Go because it's really impressive
