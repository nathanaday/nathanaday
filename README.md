Hi, I'm @nathanaday!

At the moment I'm working on a [Satellite Prediction project](https://github.com/nathanaday/SatellitePrediction) that generates satellite viewing opportunities wherever you are tonight.


I'm interested in using Python to tackle mathematical processes, especially using an object-oriented approach. For some time I have also been experimenting with optical character recognition (OCR) with the raspberry pi as I continue to broaden my knowledge of using Python for computer vision.

I'm always looking for opportunities to receive feedback and broaden my knowledge through experience. I'd be happy to collaborate on software projects dealing with engineering applications (especially in astro-engineering), mathematical components, and optical character recognition.

I have the most experience with Python, and am continuing to develop my knowledge of Java and C++.
