Hi, I'm @nathanaday!

At the moment I'm working on a Satellite Prediction project that generates satellite viewing opportunities wherever you are tonight.

My primary interests revolve around automating tasks with Python and using an object-oriented approach to tackle mathematical tasks. For some time I have also been experimenting with optical character recognition (OCR), especially with the raspberry pi, as I continue to broaden my knowledge of using Python for computer vision.

I'd be happy to collaborate on software projects dealing with engineering applications (especially in astro-engineering), mathematical components, and optical character recognition.

I have the most experience with Python, and remain proficient with Java and Matlab.
