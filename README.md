Hi, I'm @nathanaday

I have been developing software for automation, vision, and IoT for the past 4 years. I believe data visualization is just as important as data handling, and thankfully I do both.

**99% of what I work on is in private repo's! But I have an open source project in the making--more to come when I start grad school in Fall 2025**

My mains:
- 🐍 Python - The largest application I have every designed and deployed--an IoT gateway for fire detection--is entirely written in Python. I am a fan of FastAPI and Pydantic.
- 🐹 Go - Rewritting a lot of my python components in Go because it's really impressive. I frequently use the Docker SDK to create custom CI/CD pipelines.
- 🌐 Vue.js - While I spend a lot of time in the back end, people I work with know me for my nice UI's and thoughtful UX. I build with Vue.js, Vite, Tailwindcss, and Vuetify.
- 🔧 C++ - Anything from low-level device drivers and sensor layers to making high-powered GUI's with the wonderful Qt framework.
