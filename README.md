Hi, I'm @nathanaday

At the moment I'm working on a [Satellite Prediction project](https://github.com/nathanaday/SatellitePrediction) that generates satellite viewing opportunities wherever you are tonight.

My interests involve using Python to tackle mathematical processes, especially using an object-oriented approach. For some time [I have also been experimenting with optical character recognition (OCR)](https://github.com/nathanaday/RealTime-OCR) with the raspberry pi as I continue to expand my knowledge of using Python for computer vision.

I'm always looking for opportunities to receive feedback and broaden my experience through hands-on projects. I'd be happy to collaborate on software projects dealing with engineering applications (especially in astro-engineering), mathematical components, and optical character recognition.

I have the most experience with Python, and I am continuing to develop my knowledge of Java and C++.
